		<p>Swapper is now mostly done.  The controls are:</p>
		
		<p>Trackball Click / Space -- Swap with nearest enemy<br />
		Trakball -- Move<br />
		'A' -- Stop Moving</p>
		
		<p>Powerups:<br />
		Yellow - 100 Score<br />
		Green - Metal<br />
		Red - Fire Walking<br />
		Blue - 1 Life</p>
		
		<p>Dodge enemies, get powerups and don't get hit!<br />
		Enemies will die if they run into eachother.</p>

		Swapper (working title) is what I've been spending most my time working on.  It will be my first game for Blackberry and hopefully many more will follow (perhaps I'll work at Xtreme labs making these kinds of games during co-op).  It is an action game that requires only one hand to play (from personal experience, these are the only Blackberry games people seem to play).  You are the hero and scary monsters and super creeps are out to get you.  Use your cunning to get the monsters to run into each other, killing them instantly.  The one ability you have is to swap places with the nearest enemy.  And if you get bored swapping places with fiendish monsters, there are also power-ups.  Power-ups are dropped randomly upon a monster dying.  They can either have an instant effect (+ 1 life, +100 score, turn into metal (think metal Mario (nested parenthesis!  (it's just like using Lisp))), have fire come up where you walk, etc.) or they will be equipment that you can whip out at a later time (flamethrower, missile launcher, special time slowing hat, nuclear bomb, etc.).  Defeat the enemies and bosses and advance through the many levels.</p>
		
		<p>Swapper is very graphic rich and hopefully will soon be sound rich.  The game consists of many sprites, each with walking animation and dying animation and 8 different angles which they can turn (each angle requires a new sprite to be drawn, since the game angle is slanted and not a bird's eye view).  Most sprites I downloaded online with permission from the artist and then minipulated for my own need.  The <a href="/images/hero.gif">hero of the story</a> is currently being drawn by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sadleric.net/">Eric Sadler</a> (it has 10 frames for the walking animation!).  The game skeleton is done and I've made 5 levels so far.  What still needs to be done is finish adding all the sprites, add sound, add more content and then balance the game.  Hopefully I'll have a Java Applet version of the game up here soon to demo the current state of the game.</p>
